A generator for ***PocketMine-MP*** that generates oceans with islands.
*map seed: 9872, X: -1724, Y: 170, Z:790*

## How to
This plugin can't manage worlds, so you'll need another plugin to create the world.
Set the generator to *islands*. the rest is optional. Alternatively you can use pocketmine's own world manager in pocketmine.yml

**[!] Multiworld has been tested and is not compatible with this plugin**
