# PocketIslands
A generator for ***PocketMine-MP*** that generates oceans with islands.
## How to
This plugin can't manage worlds, so you'll need another plugin to create the world.
Set the generator to *islands*. the rest is optional. Alternatively you can use pocketmine's own world manager in pocketmine.yml

**[!] Multiworld has been tested and is not compatible with this plugin**

## Features
Things i have or haven't done yet:
 
 [✔] Custom generator
 
 [✔] Generate seperate islands
 
 [✖] Custom and better biomes
 
 [✖] Palm tree populator
 
 [✖] Better mountains
 
 [✖] Structures
 
Feel free to help as well. I cannot really progress the plugin if i don't implement custom biomes. Sadly this is not yet possible.
