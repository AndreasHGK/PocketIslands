# PocketIslands
![alt text](media/picture.png)
A generator for ***PocketMine-MP*** that generates oceans with islands.
## How to
This plugin can't manage worlds, so you'll need another plugin to create the world.
Set the generator to *islands*. the rest is optional. Alternatively you can use pocketmine's own world manager in pocketmine.yml

**[!] Multiworld has been tested and is not compatible with this plugin**
